Gladiator 2092 original staff:
Bruce Heiner
Jonah Scanzon
Ethan Sewall

SFX:
Hit/Kill sounds: Quake 3 (is this legally safe to use?)
Misc: 3D space cadet pinball (I think the sounds from that game are public-domain anyways)
The rest come from public-domain sound websites or are my own creation.

MUSIC:
(I think the music here is in legal limbo since the copyright holders are long dead, some of the composers may still be around, though.)
Boss theme: One Man and his Droid  - Rob Hubbard
BGM 1: Monty on the Run - Rob Hubbard
