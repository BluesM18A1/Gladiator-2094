# Gladiator-2094
Open-Source FPS for Godot Engine only using C#

MANIFESTO:

This is a "director's cut" of a multiplayer arcade-style FPS game I made in high school with 2 friends called "Gladiator 2092".
2092 was made in Unity Engine v2018.3, and half of the development time went towards figuring out the broken networking API.
2092 was never "completed" so to speak. Many features we wanted were either broken or never implemented.

As support for C# in this engine grows more feature complete, this game will be further optimized and refined.

TO-DO:

Add different kinds of enemies and bosses.
Pause Menu
High Score table

STRETCH GOALS:
Restore networked multiplayer functionality.
Global High Scores
