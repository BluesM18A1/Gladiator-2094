# Gladiator-2094
Open-Source FPS for Godot Engine only using C#

MANIFESTO:

This is a "director's cut" of a multiplayer bullet hell FPS game I made in high school with 2 friends called "Gladiator 2092".
2092 was made in Unity Engine v2018.3, and half of the development time went towards figuring out the broken networking API.
2092 was never "completed" so to speak. Many features we wanted were either broken or never implemented.
So all alone, I have decided to recreate parts of this game in the Godot Engine as a way to experiment with its features.

As the Godot Engine grows and its C# support more stable, so too, will this game grow.

TO-DO:

-Overheal mechanics

-Add different kinds of enemies and bosses,

-Background music

-High Score table

KNOWN ISSUES:

-Stuttering when too many objects spawn at once.
May not occur depending on your hardware. I will be doing my best to fix the issue, although it may have to wait until Godot 4.0, as there will be overhauls to the 3D rendering system. Beta release 2 is on hold until then.

STRETCH GOALS:

-Restore networked multiplayer functionality.

-Port this game, and the godot engine by extension, to as many platforms as possible.
