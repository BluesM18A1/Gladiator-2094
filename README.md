# Gladiator-2094
Open-Source FPS for Godot Engine only using C#

This is a "director's cut" of a multiplayer bullet hell FPS game I made in high school with 2 friends called "Gladiator 2092".
2092 was made in Unity Engine v2018.3, and half of the development time went towards figuring out the broken networking API.
2092 was never "completed" so to speak. Many features we wanted were either broken or never implemented.

So all alone, I have decided to recreate parts of this game in the Godot Engine to teach myself how to use the engine.
This codebase is effectively a playground to test certain features in Godot, and will be updated sporadically as I try new engine features.

I am releasing all the code for free distribution and commercialization, though keep in mind some audio assets are 3rd party and have unknown licensing terms.

TO-DO:
-Update project for compatibility with Godot 4.0 upon release.
-Upgrade system?

STRETCH GOALS:

-Restore networked multiplayer functionality.
