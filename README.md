# Gladiator-2094
Arcade-style Bullet Hell FPS

Based off of a school project done many years ago called "Gladiator 2092" (not to be released to the public). 
2092 was made in Unity during a time where its networking stack was in a transitional period and left completely broken with half-rewritten documentation.  
Since networked co-op multiplayer was a big part of the game's plans at the time, the project had to be cancelled.  

A few years later, I found out about the Godot Engine and decided to learn the ropes by porting the Unity game my friends and I worked on, 
and improving it any way I see fit. 

Today, it serves the purpose of being an open-source portfolio piece, and maybe one day a fully fleshed out and fun game. 

Feel free to use any code in here for your own projects, though keep in mind some audio assets are 3rd party with unknown licensing terms.

TODO LIST:  
-Port to Godot 4.0   
-Airborne enemies    
-Upgrade mechanics   
-Networked multiplayer at long last?
