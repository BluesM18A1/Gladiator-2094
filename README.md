# Gladiator-2094
Open-Source FPS for Godot Engine only using C#

MANIFESTO:

This is a "sequel" to a multiplayer arcade-style FPS game I made in high school with 2 friends called "Gladiator 2092".
2092 was made in Unity Engine v2018.3, and half of the development time went towards figuring out the broken networking API.
2092 was never "completed" so to speak. Many features we wanted were either broken or never implemented.

While C# support in the Godot Engine isn't quite feature-complete yet, as C# support grows in the Godot Engine, this game, too, will become more feature complete. This project's goal, first and foremost, is to teach both me and you about how C# works in this engine.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

A significant amount of SFX (which were imported from 2092) were stolen from other games. I will be making an effort to replace them with either stock assets, my own sounds, or properly credit their source. All other assets are my own.
