Based off of a school project done many years ago called "Gladiator 2092" (not to be released to the public). 
2092 was made in Unity during a time where its networking stack was in a transitional period and left completely broken with half-rewritten documentation.  
Since networked co-op multiplayer was a big part of the game's plans at the time, the project had to be cancelled.  

A few years later, I found out about the Godot Engine and decided to learn the ropes by porting the Unity game my friends and I worked on, 
and improving it any way I see fit. 

Today, it serves the purpose of being an open-source portfolio piece, and maybe one day a fully fleshed out and fun game. 

TODO LIST:  
Port to Godot 4.0   
Airborne enemies    
Upgrade mechanics   
Networked multiplayer at long last?
